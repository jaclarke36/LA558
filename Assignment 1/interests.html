  <p>I am very interested in Design. I read constantly and I love learning about new emerging patterns in technology and how this changes human behavior. Most recently I have been facinated to dive into predictions on how Augmented Reality will impact humans and the emmense responsibility that we have to ensure that we use this technology with ethics in mind.</p>
  <p>In my "downtime", I enjoy going to the beach. I go to a small beach along the Delaware coast called "Broadkill Beach" and I've been going there my whole life.</p>

  <p>More important to me than anything else, is my family. I live close to my parents. I spend a lot of time with my parents and grandparents at the beach. My four-year-old son is the center of my world and he is truly my best little friend. I am happily married to a wonderful man who loves his family just as much as I do. My husband is a nurse manager and is very skilled in caring for people.</p>
  <p>Other interests include: music, art, and design research </p>
