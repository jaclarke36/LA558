<h1>Final Proposal - Utilizing data from wearable computers, specifically runkeeper app data, in order to visualize my past activity</h1>

<body>

What I'd  like to do: Take data from my runkeeper app that has been trackign my runs and use that to create a map of some of my favorite runs.

  Fitness Activity through maps
  <br><br>
  I will choose one or two fitness apps that track routes that I take either waking, running or cycling. I will use this data to create a visual of past activity. 
  <br><br>
  My project will show my progress as a runner over the course of a few months, specifcally the length of the routes. I will attempt to categorize the runs based on speed (i.e.- Fastest 3 mile run, fastest 6+ run... etc). 
  <br><br>
  I will use leaflet, json, geogson
  <br><br>
  I will take GPX data and convert it to Geojson or shapefiles in some cases (depending on what is required by the app)
  <br><br>
  I am sure I will have many challenges and might need some help figuring out how to convert the file. I need to look at some JSBINs from previous lectured and  work with that code as a base. I'm not sure how to get data from the fitness app on my watch yet. I use runkeeper and my watch together. 
  <br><br>
  I am going to look for some youtube tutorials today.
