  <p>Hello my name is Jennifer Clarke. My maiden name is Stant. I am a student at Iowa state. My undergrad degree was in communications. I then earned an MBA. I am now working towards a Masters in HCI. I work for QVC as their Global UX and Design Director. I am surrounded by highly talented professionals and I am looking to deepen my knowledge of collaborative web development software and basic website development. I am quite intimidated by coding, but I'm hoping this class will help.</p>
  <p>Hometown: Philadelphia, PA</p>
  <p>Currently Reside in Wilmington, DE</p>
  <p>Major: HCI Human Computer Interaction</p>
  <p>Job: UX Director for QVC</p>
  <h5>I am the mother of a beautiful 4 year old boy. I have been married for 14 years and I really enjoy spending time with my family at the beach. We spend most of our summer weekends on the beach and I can't wait for the warm weather to return for this reason.</h5>
